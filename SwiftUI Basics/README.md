# Swift UI

SwiftUI is a modern declarative user interface framework for building iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS apps using the Swift programming language.

It provides a simple and intuitive way to create user interface with a live preview, enabling developers to see their changes in real-time.

SwiftUI also offers a range of built-in user interface controls and supports dynamic type, and dark mode out of the box.
